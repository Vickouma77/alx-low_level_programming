BIT MANIPULATION

Bit manipulation is the act of manipulating bits or other pieces 
of data shorter than a byte.

BITWISE OPERATORS
The bitwise operators allow us to deal with characters and integers
data in binary form, as explicit strings of bits.
They work on operands of pseudo type integral,'integral' being understood 
to include all signed and unsigned data types of char and int, including 
shorter ints as well.

One's complement operator (~)

Bitwise AND operator (&)

Bitwise OR operator (|)

Bitwise XOR operator (^)
